# Intro

HyperAST code is open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/quentinLeDilavrec/HyperAST). This book is also open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/quentinLeDilavrec/HyperAST/book) in the same repo.

HyperAST is a research project at IRISA, Rennes, France. It is a tool to analyze git repositories and extract information from them. It is written in Rust.

The HyperAST is not made for to analyse a single repository. It is made to analyse a set of repositories over time. It is meant to analyse the evolution of a code base over time, to understand where a bug is comming from, to see how a piece of code has evolved over time, etc.

It is meant to be state of the art and fast to be able to be used on big code bases in real time.

> This book is here to make it easier to understand how to use HyperAST for any programmers(understanding the API but mainly how to use the GUI). It it also here to explain how to contribute to the project (mainly add support for new language).

# Quickstart

In this section you'll find quickstart example about the HyperAST. 

> Quickstarts mentioning (GUI) are using the graphical interface of the HyperAST.

The project is divided in two parts :
- the **GUI** for having a graphical interface with the HyperAST
- the **API** for having full control over the HyperAST


## [Compute code metrics (GUI)](./quickstart/compute_code_metrics.md)

A scripting language is available to compute metrics on multiple commits in the repository of your choice.

## [Track code (GUI)](./quickstart/track_code.md)

The HyperAST enables you to easily track code changes across thousands of commits.

## [Add a TreeSitter grammar](./quickstart/add_treesitter_grammar.md)

In the HyperAST you can add a TreeSitter grammar to handle more programming languages.
